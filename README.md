# Basketball-Data-Visualization
We are still in the process of finishing this project, therefore please keep in mind that the visualizations displayed here are far from finished. A lot of changes shall be made in the future. In the rest of this document, I will attempt to explain the purpose of each visualization. 


GameClock
  GameClock allows coaches to analyze a single game on a play-by-play level. Please note the source of the data is play-by-play data merged with SportsVU data, that is why we were able to obtain the location of each play that takes place during a game.
  
  Let us take a look at the x-axis of this visualization. The x-axis represents the time of a single game. The left starting point represents the beginning of a game, and the right ending point represents the ending of a game. Notice that this visualization is split into four quadrants, where each quadrant represents one single quarter. 
  
  Now let us look at the y-axis of this visualizaiton. THe y-axis represents distance away from the basket in feet raning from 0 to 30. Also notice that the visualization is split into two segments: upper half and bottom half. Upper half represents the home team, and bottom half represetns the away team. 
  
  You will see a lot of symbols attached with a line on this diagram. Each symbol represents the kind of play that takes place during a game. The definition of each symbol is shown on the very top of the visualization. Each line and symbol are colored coded in red or green. Green means a positive play, and red means a negative play. To drive the point home, I will give you guys an example.
