# Basketball-Data-Visualization
We are still in the midst of finishing this project, so the visualizations displayed here are by no means finished. A lot of changes will be made in the future, but I will briefly explain what each visualization means. 


GameClock
  GameClock allows coaches to study one single baskbetall game on a play-by-play level. Please note that the source of the data is play-by-play data merged with SportsVU data. By merging two types of data, we were able to obtain the location information of each play that takes place during a game.
